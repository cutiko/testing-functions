## Overview
In this simple repo you will learn how to use most of the feautures in Firebase Functions

1. User registration listener
2. Database nodes listener
3. Query other nodes
4. Set value to other nodes
5. Send Firebase Cloud Message notifications

I hope to help you to solve the most common simple problems while developing applications: **business logic and push notifications**

# Installation

1. You have to do the [Firebase Functions Get Started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started) or simply watch the [8 minutes video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvV9Vk9iOCQ)
2. The first step should teach you how to create a Functions Project, do it and then replace the content of the original index.js for the provided here
3. Don't forget to deploy to your project
4. If you wish to see the notification you can use this [Android Project](https://github.com/cutiko/FunctionTesting)

## Recomendations

1. For using Functions add `console.log` everywhere, one step, one log
2. For testing the notification use a real device, emulators are not realiable with notifications
